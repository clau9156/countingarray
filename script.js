// counts in the console
// new line every count

// every second "counter" increments(++) by 1

// "counter" then added to the start of an array

// array is "truncated" never becomes longer than 9

// array logged to the console

// DESIGN
// two variables: the counter & the array
// only one should be "let" variable

// one function
function something() {
    // make a progtam that counts (with time delay)

    // <--- modify the program to insert the counter-value in the beginning of the array

    // <--- modify the program again, to make sure the array doesnt get longer than nine items.
